Day 2 : 
Day 3 :  ( Didn't cover as much from the video but did some revision of what was already done to better                             understand what is going on )
Day 4 :  ( Loops are lowkey confusing so will spend some time doing a few exercises online  )
Day 5 :  ( I'm trying to find some exercises online to practice the knowledge because I struggle with the                                                                                    exercises Mosh is giving us even though I have the necessary information to solve them )
Day 6 :  ( Tomorrow I'm only gonna try different exercises in Python so I can improve my ability to code so I won't be advancing any minutes in the video )
Day 7:  (Ok now its getting in way deeper waters , its a bit harder to keep up lmao , constructers  and classes are kinda hard )
Break: I havent been able to continue the course daily as ive had a lot of school work to do and continuing this course has been hard but I will start again during this weekend as holiday season start for me.",48:40:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=2920s,41,8 replies

This was my first source of information, when I got back from work (being a cable tech), and typed “Python full course” or something along those lines. 

Of course, back then, a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me, and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly. However, I was so sick of my job and I absolutely saw no growth in doing cable, where the salary cap for a technician was probably IT jobs base pay for the most part, so I decided to Google every single thing I don’t understand.

   Do not try watching the entire video at once. Limit your watch time from 30 or 60 minutes each day and make sure to participate and understand the code. This will take around a week to complete, but it will save you from feeling like you're not good enough. Don't rush yourself. Limit and pay attention!

EDIT: It also helps if you take notes or take a picture of the final result of the lesson. It is very helpful to look at when you're away from your computer. If you forget, you have a chance to examine the code and see how and why things work.",,,2K,68 replies

don't worry if you watched 5 minutes of his video and ended up practicing for 60 minutes. That's actually the most practical way to learn. Here is how i learn :

I finish two topics and then i spend time practicing both of them together, then when i learn the next topic i practice all three topics together. That way i don't forget. Don't get frustrated just slow down relax and practice and before you know it you'll be done :)

Pro tips
: If you're watching in laptop watch in cinema mode [full screen] 
Open a google docs or a word document and write some code that. you find hard to understand and then learn it step by step.
Before starting to watch the video again, review the material and revise it before learning a new topic
You can refer to his cheat sheet too! Anytime you're stuck :) You can also make your own cheat sheet :)",,,427,16 replies
